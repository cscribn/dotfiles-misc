# Agent Instructions

Scope: applies to all agents unless overridden by specifics.

## Applications

- One run command; use env vars for runtime modes.
- Load config from `.env`; keep `.env.example` synced; never hardcode secrets.
- No premature abstraction unless requested.
- Use explicit types over generic open-ended configs.
- Proactively maintain `.gitignore` for artifacts, secrets, local env.

## Bash Shell Scripting

- `#!/bin/bash`
- `set -o nounset`
- `set -o pipefail`
- `[[ "${TRACE-0}" = "1" ]] && set -o xtrace`
- Use quoted expansions and `[[ ... ]]`.
- Use one `main()` entry point: `main "${@}"`.

## Core Principles

- Prioritize correctness; don't fabricate/speculate; state uncertainty/interpretation.
- Don't use em/en dashes.
- Edit only related code unless explicitly asked.
- Authoritative spec: `requirements.md`. If request conflicts, ask which wins.
- Supplemental detail in `requirements/*`: skip unless needed for task.
- Operator guide: `README.md` (build/run/env); don't copy in requirements.

## GitHub CLI

- Use `gh` CLI (no Octokit/direct HTTP clients).
- REST listing/commits: `gh api --paginate` (no `--jq`).
- Use GraphQL for PRs/reviews.
- Respect rate limits with wait-until-reset retry.

## Java & Spring Boot

- Use `./gradlew` for build/run.
- Use toolchains, src/ layout.
- Keep controllers thin; services handle business/data flow.
- Use JPA migrations; parameterized DB access.
- Env vars for config (no CLI args).

## Jira API

- Use `/rest/api/3/search/jql` for JQL.
- Use pagination (`nextPageToken`, `isLast`, `maxResults`).
- Handle 401/403/rate-limit explicitly.
- Use bulk endpoints.

## Local LLM

- Runtime: Ollama only.
- Model: `llama3.2:3b` (pull before run).
- Enforce JSON output.
- Timeout >= 120s.
- Keep prompts < 500 tokens, synthetic examples only.
- Retry transient failures with bounded backoff.

## Python & Flask

- Use `uv` for env/deps/run.
- Use toolchains; src/ layout.
- isort, mypy, abc, @property.
- Env vars for config.
- Flask: app factory + blueprints; DB outside routes; SQL params only.

## Quality

- Keep functions small, cohesive (<= 40 lines, low complexity).
- Remove dead code, unused imports.
- Extract repeated logic when appearing 3+ times.
- Add/update tests for behavior changes.
- Keep README, `requirements.md` in sync with behavior/config changes.
- Use actionable error messages.

## Responses

- Bullets over paragraphs.
- Drop: articles, filler, pleasantries, hedging.
- Fragments OK; short synonyms; technical terms exact; code unchanged.
- Pattern: [thing] [action] [reason]. [next step].
